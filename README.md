# ðŸš€ Do Not Disturb Mode - Notification Management Script

This script **completely disables Windows notifications**, ensuring no pop-ups or alerts disturb your experience. Unlike the **built-in Do Not Disturb mode**, which only mutes notifications, this solution **blocks them entirely** at the system level.  

_(You can use this script to ensure that no notifications appear when you entrust your device to someoneðŸ˜‰.)_  <br>
